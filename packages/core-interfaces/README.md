# APIMatic Core Interfaces Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides essential type definitions and interfaces that define how SDK components communicate.

The exported types and interfaces include:

1. **API Response**: Standardized response structures for API calls.
2. **Authentication**: Interfaces defining authentication adapters and interceptors.
3. **HTTP Context and Client**: Core abstractions for HTTP request/response handling and client implementations.
4. **Interceptor**: Definitions for HTTP interceptors enabling request/response transformation and middleware behavior.
5. **Retry Configuration**: Types and interfaces for configuring retry logic in network calls.
6. **Logging**: Contracts for logging within HTTP clients and SDK operations.
7. **Paged Async Iterables**: Type support for async iteration over paged API results.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/core-interfaces')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/core-interfaces'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/core-interfaces@VERSION/umd/core-interfaces.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
