# APIMatic File Wrapper Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides utilities for wrapping files with metadata for HTTP requests.

The exported classes and functions include:

1. **File Wrapper Class**: Encapsulates a file (Blob or stream) along with optional metadata such as MIME type, filename, and custom headers for multipart HTTP requests.
2. **Type Guard for File Wrapper**: Identifies if a given value is an instance of the File Wrapper class.
3. **Deep Cloning**: Creates a deep copy of a File Wrapper instance, including its metadata and headers.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/file-wrapper')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/file-wrapper'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/file-wrapper@VERSION/umd/file-wrapper.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._  

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
