# APIMatic OAuth Adapters Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides pluggable adapters for OAuth 2.0 authentication schemes.

The exported functionality includes:

1. **Request Authentication Provider**: Creates pluggable authentication interceptors for API requests, managing token usage, automatic token refresh, and setting authentication headers.
2. **Token Validity Check**: Checks whether the provided OAuth token is defined.
3. **Token Expiration Validation**: Determines whether the provided OAuth token is expired, with optional clock skew adjustment.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/oauth-adapters')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/oauth-adapters'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/oauth-adapters@VERSION/umd/oauth-adapters.js` |  
| Modern Browsers (supports ESM and uses modern JS) | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/oauth-adapters@VERSION/umd/oauth-adapters.esm.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
