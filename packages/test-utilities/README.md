# APIMatic Test Utilities Libary for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides assertion utilities for testing api calls. It can be plugged in as dev dependency to any library.

The exported helper functions include:

1. **getStreamData**: Get streaming data from a given URL.
2. **expectStreamsMatching**: Check if input data matches the expected stream data or Blob data.
3. **expectHeadersToMatch**: Compare actual headers with expected headers, ignoring case sensitivity.
4. **expectMatchingWithOptions**: Check whether the expected value is matching with the actual value, with the given comparison options.

This library is used as a dev-dependency by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v10+
1. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
1. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/test-utilities')`. |
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/test-utilities'`. |
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/test-utilities@VERSION/umd/schema.js` |
| Modern Browsers (supports ESM and uses modern JS) | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/test-utilities@VERSION/umd/schema.esm.js` |

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
