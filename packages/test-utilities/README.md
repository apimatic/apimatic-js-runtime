# APIMatic Test Utilities Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides assertion utilities for testing api calls. It can be plugged in as dev dependency to any library.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Stream Data Retrieval**: Retrieves streaming data from a given URL.
* **Buffer Conversion**: Creates a Buffer instance from a Node.js readable stream or a Blob.
* **Header Comparison**: Compares actual headers with expected headers, ignoring case sensitivity.
* **Value Matching with Options**: Checks whether the expected value matches the actual value using specified comparison options.

This library is used as a dev-dependency by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).
