# APIMatic Axios Client Adapter Library for JavaScript

Provides a robust HTTP client implementation by wrapping the Axios library, enabling seamless HTTP request execution with extended features.

1. **Axios-Based HTTP Client**: Robust HTTP client built on Axios for reliable API communication.
2. **Request/Response Transformation**: Automatic conversion between APIMatic HTTP interfaces and Axios formats.
3. **File Upload Support**: Multipart form data and stream uploads with proper content type handling.
4. **Proxy Configuration**: Configurable proxy support for enterprise environments.
5. **Timeout and Abort Support**: Configurable request timeouts with integrated abort signal handling for graceful cancellation.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/axios-client-adapter')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/axios-client-adapter'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/axios-client-adapter@VERSION/umd/axios-client-adapter.js` |  
| Modern Browsers (supports ESM and uses modern JS) | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/axios-client-adapter@VERSION/umd/axios-client-adapter.esm.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
