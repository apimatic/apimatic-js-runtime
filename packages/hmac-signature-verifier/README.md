# APIMatic HMAC Signature Verifier Library for JavaScript SDKs
> This package is only supported in Node.js environments and is **not** compatible with browsers.

This package provides utilities for verifying HMAC signatures in HTTP requests.

The exported functionality includes:

* **HMAC Signature Verification**: Validate request signatures using configurable algorithms (e.g., SHA256, SHA512) and secret keys.
* **Header and Payload Support**: Verify signatures based on request headers, body, or combined payloads.
* **Algorithm Flexibility**: Support for multiple HMAC algorithms and encoding formats.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
