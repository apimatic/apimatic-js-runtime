# APIMatic HTTP Headers Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides utilities for managing HTTP headers with case-insensitive handling and validation.

The exported functionality includes:

1. **Case-Insensitive Header Management**: Set, replace, and retrieve headers without case sensitivity.
2. **Conditional Header Addition**: Adds headers only if they are not already set.
3. **Header Name Lookup**: Identifies the actual header name in a map regardless of casing differences.
4. **Headers Merging**: Merges multiple header maps, preserving original casing while updating values as needed.
5. **Headers Validation**: Validates header names to ensure compliance with HTTP standards.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/http-headers')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/http-headers'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/http-headers@VERSION/umd/http-headers.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
