# APIMatic HTTP Query Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides utilities for encoding and formatting URL query parameters.

The exported functions include:

1. **Array Prefix Formats**: Support for indexed, unindexed, plain, comma, tab, and pipe-separated array formats.
2. **Complex Object Serialization**: Handles deep object structures and nested arrays in query parameter encoding.
3. **File Wrapper Integration**: Automatically detects and processes FileWrapper instances in query parameters.
4. **URL Encoding**: Performs proper URL encoding with customizable prefix formats for arrays.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/http-query')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/http-query'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/http-query@VERSION/umd/http-query.js` |  
| Modern Browsers (supports ESM and uses modern JS) | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/http-query@VERSION/umd/http-query.esm.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
