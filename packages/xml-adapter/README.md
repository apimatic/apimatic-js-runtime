# APIMatic XML Adapter Library for JavaScript

> This library is currently in preview.

Provides XML serialization and deserialization utilities for apimatic-js-runtime libraries using xml2js for robust XML processing.

The exported helper functions include:

1. **XML Serialization**: Convert JavaScript objects to XML strings with configurable root elements
2. **XML Deserialization**: Parse XML strings into JavaScript objects using a Promise-based API

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/xml-adapter')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/xml-adapter'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/xml-adapter@VERSION/umd/xml-adapter.js` |  
| Modern Browsers (supports ESM and uses modern JS) | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/xml-adapter@VERSION/umd/xml-adapter.esm.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
