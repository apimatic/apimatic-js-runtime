# APIMatic XML Adapter Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides XML serialization and deserialization utilities for apimatic-js-runtime libraries using xml2js for robust XML processing.

The exported helper functions include:

* **XML Serialization**: Convert JavaScript objects to XML strings with configurable root elements
* **XML Deserialization**: Parse XML strings into JavaScript objects using a Promise-based API

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
