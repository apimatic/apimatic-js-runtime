# APIMatic Convert-to-Stream Library for JavaScript

Provides utility functions to convert data between streams and blobs, with automatic platform-specific handling for both Node.js and browser environments.

> This library is currently in preview.

The exported functionality includes:

- **Cross-Platform Stream Conversion**: Automatically detects the runtime environment to convert data between Node.js streams and browser Blob objects.
- **Bidirectional Data Conversion**: Enables conversion between strings, streams, and blobs for flexible and seamless data handling.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io).

## Builds

The following environments are supported:

1. Node.js v14.15.0+
2. Bundlers like Rollup or Webpack
3. Web browsers

To support multiple environments, we export various builds:

| Environment | Usage |  
| --- | --- |  
| Common.js | Import like this: `require('@apimatic/convert-to-stream')`. |  
| ES Module | Import like this: `import { /* your imports */ } from '@apimatic/convert-to-stream'`. |  
| Browsers | *Use script: `https://unpkg.com/@apimatic/convert-to-stream@VERSION/umd/convert-to-stream.js` |  

_* Don't forget to replace VERSION with the version number._

**Note**: We discourage importing files or modules directly from the package. These are likely to change in the future and should not be considered stable.
