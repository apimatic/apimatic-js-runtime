# APIMatic Convert-to-Stream Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides utility functions to convert data between streams and blobs, with automatic platform-specific handling for both Node.js and browser environments.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Cross-Platform Stream Conversion**: Automatically detects the runtime environment to convert data between Node.js streams and browser Blob objects.
* **Bidirectional Data Conversion**: Enables conversion between strings, streams, and blobs for flexible and seamless data handling.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
